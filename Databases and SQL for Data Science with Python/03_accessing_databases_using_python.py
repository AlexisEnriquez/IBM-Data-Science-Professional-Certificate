''''
Connect to Db2 database on Cloud using Python
Estimated time needed: 15 minutes

Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

Import the ibm_db Python library
Enter the database connection credentials
Create the database connection
Close the database connection
Note: Please follow the instructions given in the first Lab of this course to Create a database service instance of Db2 on Cloud and retrieve your database Service Credentials.

Import the ibm_db Python library
The ibm_db API provides a variety of useful Python functions for accessing and manipulating data in an IBMÂ® data server database, including functions for connecting to a database, preparing and issuing SQL statements, fetching rows from result sets, calling stored procedures, committing and rolling back transactions, handling errors, and retrieving metadata.

We first import the ibm_db library into our Python Application

Execute the following cell by clicking within it and then press Shift and Enter keys simultaneously
'''
import ibm_db

''''
Identify the database connection credentials
Connecting to dashDB or DB2 database requires the following information:

Driver Name
Database name
Host DNS name or IP address
Host port
Connection protocol
User ID (or username)
User Password
Notice: To obtain credentials please refer to the instructions given in the first Lab of this course
'''
#Replace the placeholder values with your actual Db2 hostname, username, and password:
dsn_hostname = "dashdb-txn-sbox-yp-dal09-11.services.dal.bluemix.net" # e.g.: "dashdb-txn-sbox-yp-dal09-04.services.dal.bluemix.net"
dsn_uid = "smz55205"        # e.g. "abc12345"
dsn_pwd = "db8-q34k6b85vnrq;"      # e.g. "7dBZ3wWt9XN6$o0J"

dsn_driver = "{IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER}"
dsn_database = "BLUDB"            # e.g. "BLUDB"
dsn_port = "50000"                # e.g. "50000" 
dsn_protocol = "TCPIP"            # i.e. "TCPIP"

''''
Create the DB2 database connection
Ibm_db API uses the IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC and CLI APIs to connect to IBM DB2 and Informix.

Lets build the dsn connection string using the credentials you entered above
'''

#DO NOT MODIFY THIS CELL. Just RUN it with Shift + Enter
#Create the dsn connection string
dsn = (
    "DRIVER={0};"
    "DATABASE={1};"
    "HOSTNAME={2};"
    "PORT={3};"
    "PROTOCOL={4};"
    "UID={5};"
    "PWD={6};").format(dsn_driver, dsn_database, dsn_hostname, dsn_port, dsn_protocol, dsn_uid, dsn_pwd)

#print the connection string to check correct values are specified
print(dsn)

#Now establish the connection to the database
#DO NOT MODIFY THIS CELL. Just RUN it with Shift + Enter
#Create database connection

try:
    conn = ibm_db.connect(dsn, "", "")
    print ("Connected to database: ", dsn_database, "as user: ", dsn_uid, "on host: ", dsn_hostname)

except:
    print ("Unable to connect: ", ibm_db.conn_errormsg() )

#Congratulations if you were able to connect successfuly. Otherwise check the error and try again.
#Retrieve Metadata for the Database Server
server = ibm_db.server_info(conn)

print ("DBMS_NAME: ", server.DBMS_NAME)
print ("DBMS_VER:  ", server.DBMS_VER)
print ("DB_NAME:   ", server.DB_NAME)

#Retrieve Metadata for the Database Client / Driver
client = ibm_db.client_info(conn)

print ("DRIVER_NAME:          ", client.DRIVER_NAME) 
print ("DRIVER_VER:           ", client.DRIVER_VER)
print ("DATA_SOURCE_NAME:     ", client.DATA_SOURCE_NAME)
print ("DRIVER_ODBC_VER:      ", client.DRIVER_ODBC_VER)
print ("ODBC_VER:             ", client.ODBC_VER)
print ("ODBC_SQL_CONFORMANCE: ", client.ODBC_SQL_CONFORMANCE)
print ("APPL_CODEPAGE:        ", client.APPL_CODEPAGE)
print ("CONN_CODEPAGE:        ", client.CONN_CODEPAGE)

#Close the connection
ibm_db.close(conn)
